# Docker Compose Guide
This is a condensed version of what I use myself, docker simplifies the whole process and nicely compartmentalises installation of dependencies etc. I even use it to run Home Assistant.

## Setup
1. Install docker & docker-compose (if you've come this far, you know how to use Google)
2. Copy the docker-compose directory from examples in this repo: [here](../../examples/docker-compose)

# Grott (grott)
This custom component (installable via HACS) is designed to integrate with an installation of Grott and will display metrics pushed via MQTT.

This integration is designed to replace the use of the [growatt-server-api](https://github.com/muppet3000/homeassistant-growatt_server_api) Integration which has had numerous problems due to API instability)

If anyone wants to say 'thanks' for the integration, feel free to click something below.....

# Features
This is a sensor to collect information from your Growatt inverters using [Grott](https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott).

A detailed setup guide for Grott & MQTT can be found [here](https://github.com/muppet3000/homeassistant-grott/blob/main/docs/prerequisites.md)

In the future the Integration will be expanded to allow pushing of configuration settings e.g. off-peak AC charging windows via grott also.
